# Demonstration of Orion on the Sepsis Event Log

This page demonstrates orion by analyzing the [Sepsis](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Sepsis_Cases_-_Event_Log/12707639) event log. This event log is especially appropriate for change pattern analysis, as it includes two measurement activities (CRP and Leucocytes). We will demonstrate, how orion can be used to retrieve novel insights from Sepsis. A detailed case study can also be found [here](https://github.com/bptlab/Context-Aware-Change-Pattern-Detection), where we also discuss the meaning of the results.

## Main Page

After uploading the event log, the user arrives at the main page to perform the data-preprocessing and analysis steps described in the paper.
